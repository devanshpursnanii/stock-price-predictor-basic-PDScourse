# Basic Stock Price Predictor
This project was developed as part of the Python for Data Science (PDS) course. A machine learning-based stock price forecasting tool developed as part of the Python for Data Science (PDS) course project. This project explores the use of classical ML models to predict stock prices, supported by thorough data analysis, visualization, and performance evaluation.

 ##Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn (ML model training and tuning)
- Pandas (data manipulation and preprocessing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)
- Google Colab (development and experimentation)

##Project Features
- Trained multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and more) using historical stock data
- Performed hyperparameter tuning and compared models based on metrics like RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE
- Visualized trends, correlations, and residuals to assess model effectiveness
- Applied robust data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering techniques

###Files Included
File	Description
- Main Colab notebook containing code, visualizations, and analysis
- Final project report documenting methodology, results, and insights
- Summary presentation used for project submission

###How to Run
You can open and run the notebook directly in Google Colab
(Upload the notebook and execute cells sequentially after mounting/importing the dataset)

##Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with the end-to-end ML workflow
- Practical application of regression models to real-world financial data
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning strategies
- Clear understanding of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
